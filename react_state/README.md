# react_state

This folder contains the React State exercises for the Holberton School project.

Structure:

- task_0/dashboard — Dashboard React app used for the state and lifecycle exercises.

What I changed:

- Implemented local `displayDrawer` state and handlers in `App`.
- Wired `Notifications` to use the handlers and updated tests.

Run tests (if this project has a `package.json` with test scripts):

```bash
cd react_state/task_0/dashboard
npm install
npm test
```
